# Amihan Exam
    Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude for this program challenge since it really exercised my fundamentals in programming especially towards simple algorithms that I learned during college which I was fortunate enough to remember and review for this challenge. 

    I have added other proponents per problem sets like a user input for testing other test cases. In order to test my problem set solutions, you do not have to change directory since I exported each problem_set outside of its folders so you can just use the command "node problem_1.js", "node problem_2.js", and "node problem_3.js" to test every problem sets that I have answered.

    That would be all, have a wonderful day ahead.
